\f0\fs24 \cf0 To check for concurrency (checkpoint 1), we use \'91telnet\'92\
- We start our echo server on one terminal on the vagrant linux box. Then we open multiple terminals and telnet to the echo server as if they were clients with the command \'91telnet localist 9034\'92\
- The correct behavior is to receive a response only on the client that pinged the server. The response in this case is just an echo of what was said.\
\
To check for HEAD, GET and POST, we use \'91curl\'92 as follows:\
\
HEAD test\
input: curl -I locahost:9034\
\
response:\
vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant/DistSystems/one_direction$ curl -I localhost:9034\
HTTP/1.1 200 OK\
Server: lisod/1.0\
Connection: keep-alive\
